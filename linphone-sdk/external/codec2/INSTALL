Installation Instructions for codec2
------------------------------------

The CMake configuration for codec2 should be considered experimental at
this time but has been thouroughly tested on Fedora Linux and cross-compiling 
from linux to windows with mingw and has many advanages over the autotools
config. 

1/ Builds against system libraries by default.
2/ Has experimental NSIS packaing support for Windows (WIN32) targets. *nix
   systems should rely on 'make install' as the packages (RPM & DEB) created by
   CPack are questionable.


Building and installing
-----------------------

Out-of-source builds are preferred. To build codec2, make a directory anywhere
underneath (or outside of) the source directory.

Linux command line example:

    $ cd /path/to/codec2
    $ mkdir build_linux
    $ cd build_linux
    $ cmake ../ (defaults to /usr/local, use CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX to override)
    (if no errors)
    $ make
    (as root)
    $ make install

Codec2 installs to /usr/local by defailt on *nix systems but can be overriden
by passing options to cmake during configuration.

Some options that may be of interest:
    1/ CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX: Defaults to /usr/local
    2/ CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE: Defaults to Release
    3/ CMAKE_C_FLAGS: Additional build flags.

These can be modified on the command line by using the "-D" option when running
cmake:
    
    $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr
