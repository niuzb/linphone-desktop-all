mssilk - mediastreamer2 (linphone) plugin for SILK codec.

This package downloads and builds the SILK codec from Skype.

By default, the upstream package installs into /usr/local.  Please use
'./configure --prefix' to change it

To prevent executing unknown scripts or code, the downloaded files are checked
against their known MD5 checksums.

To compile on Windows using Visual Studio you need to install wget and unzip from the GnuWin32 project and put them in your path. You can download them from http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/
